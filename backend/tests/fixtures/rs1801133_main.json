Also known as C677T, Ala222Val, and A222V, it encodes a variant in the [[MTHFR]] gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in [[folate]] [[drug metabolism|metabolism]]. \n\nHomozygous [[rs1801133(T;T)]] individuals have ~30% of the expected MTHFR enzyme activity, and [[rs1801133]](C;T) heterozygotes have ~65% activity, compared to the most common genotype, [[rs1801133]](C;C). \n\n\"[https://blog.23andme.com/health-traits/our-take-on-the-mthfr-gene/ Our Take on The MTHFR Gene],\" is a 23andMe blog posting (January 5, 2017), a meta-analysis finding that the past two decades of scientific evidence as it relates to specific MTHFR-influenced health conditions to be inconclusive or conflicting, with two exceptions, 1. women with two copies of C677T variant, 2. a very rare variant that may cause [[homocystinuria]]. Their takeaway, \"Based on the existing data, scientists at 23andMe have concluded that people should not interpret their genotypes at the common MTHFR variants as having an effect on their health.\"\n\nThis reduced activity (i.e. this SNP) has been linked at least once to each of the following disorders (though not necessarily reproducibly):\n\n* [[autism]]\n* [[cancer]], including\n** [[gastric cancer]]\n** [[lung cancer]]\n** [[head and neck cancer]]\n** [[renal cancer]]\n* [[cleft lip]] and [[cleft palate]]\n* [[coronary artery disease]]\n* [[dementia]]\n* [[depression]]\n* [[hyperhomocysteinemia]]\n* [[migraine]]\n* [[neural tube defects]]\n* [[pre-eclampsia]] (gestational [[hypertension]])\n* [[schizophrenia]]\n* [[thrombosis]]\n* [[down syndrome]]\n\nPubMed lists over 3,000 studies linking [[rs1801133]] to a long list of disorders in various populations across the world, of which only some are mentioned above. Considering the central role of MTHFR in folate metabolism and in control of homocysteine levels this is not surprising. A nice summary of the pathological significance of elevated homocysteine levels could be found in [http://www.lef.org/protocols/heart_circulatory/homocysteine_reduction_01.htm this] article. However, despite the evidence that folic acid and other vitamins can reduce homocysteine levels, a review of 8 clinical trials concluded that the supplements provided no benefit in terms of decreasing blood clots, heart disease, cancer or overall mortality.{{PMID|21069462}}\n\nWith regard to [[gastric cancer]], a meta-analysis combining 16 studies and ~2,700 patients concluded that the increased risk (odds ratio) associated with [[rs1801133]] (T;T) and (C;T) genotypes, was 1.52 (CI 1.31-1.77) and 1.17 (CI 0.99-1.39), respectively, compared to the (C;C) genotype. Roughly the same risks were seen for Caucasians and Asians. Smoking and having low folate levels (presumably from diets low in fruits and veggies) increased the risk for (T;T) individuals from ~1.5x to ~2x, whereas having high folate levels almost reduced the risk for (T;T) genotypes pretty much down to the (C;C) level, ie. the average risk. {{PMID|18162478}}\n\nAnother meta-analysis of three studies on [[rs1801133]] stratified according to dietary folate intake showed an increased risk for individuals with low folate intake (OR=1.37, CI: 0.92-2.06 for head and neck cancer and OR=1.28, CI: 0.97-1.68 for lung) versus high folate intake (OR=0.85, CI: 0.63-1.16 for head and neck cancer, and OR=0.94, CI: 0.79-1.12 for lung).{{PMID|18789576}}\n\n[[rs1801131]] and [[rs1801133]] have been linked to increased risk for several types of brain [[cancer]]. The highest risk of meningioma was associated with heterozygosity for both MTHFR SNPs (odds ratio 2.11, CI: 1.42-3.12, p=0.002). The corresponding odds ratio for glioma was 1.23 (CI: 0.91-1.66, p=0.02. In general, risks were increased with genotypes associated with reduced MTHFR activity.{{PMID|18483342}}\n\nBased on a study of 25,000 Caucasian women followed for 11 years (on average), the [[rs1801133]](T;T) genotype individual was less likely to have migraine with aura (odds ratio 0.79, CI: 0.65-0.9 6, p = 0.02) and did not have increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, if a (T;T) genotype did have migraine with aura, then the risk for cardiovascular disease was increased 3.66 fold (CI: 1.69-7.90, p = 0.001). This was apparently driven by a 4x increased risk for ischemic stroke (multivariable-adjusted relative risk 4.19, CI: 1.38-12.74, p = 0.01).{{PMID|18672474|OA=1\n}}\n\nA study of 677 patients with [[end-stage renal disease]] (ESRD) concluded that the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality in all patients was 2.27 (CI: 1.07 - 4.84, p = 0.03) for [[rs1801133]](T;T) homozygotes, in other words, they died at about twice the rate of the other 2 genotypes over the time course of this study.{{PMID|19272686}}\n\nIn a case-control study of 152 cases (men) and 304 age-matched healthy controls conducted in one geographical area of Iran, evidence was seen that the MTHFR polymorphisms might contribute to increased clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) risk in men. After controlling for confounding factors, a significant increase in CCRCC risk was found among carriers of the 677CT genotype compared with those with the 677CC genotype (odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.31-3.76), with a significant trend (P=0.014). Statistically significant odds ratios were also found in patients homozygous for MTHFR C677T, who have a 1.58-fold higher risk of developing CCRCC (95% confidence interval=1.21-2.44; P=0.024). Compared with the MTHFR 677CC genotype, the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the MTHFR 677TT genotype was 6.18 (95% confidence interval=4.75-8.34) for stage IV cancer and 4.68 (95% confidence interval=2.72-6.54) for grade 3 CCRCC (both P=0.0001). Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol). 2012 May;24(4):269-81. doi: 10.1016/j.clon.2011.03.005. Epub 2011 Apr 13. {{PMID|21489764}}\n\n{{PMID|19648163|OA=1\n}} A 2-year follow-up study of 122 newly diagnosed patients with [[acute lymphoblastic leukemia]] (ALL) found that carriers of a [[rs1801133]](T) allele were at increased risk for hepatic toxicity from [[methotrexate]] treatment. Hepatic toxicity was increased ~2x and ~5x for heterozygous and homozygous [[rs1801133]](T) genotypes, respectively (p=0.028). If a carrier of a [[rs1801133]](T) allele was also a carrier of a [[rs70991108]] deletion allele, the risk for hepatic toxicity was even higher (odds ratio 6.8, p=0.018).\n\n'''Note:''' Another SNP in

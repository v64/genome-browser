The COMT gene codes for the COMT enzyme, which breaks down dopamine in the brain's prefrontal cortex.  The wild-type allele is a (G), coding for a valine amino acid; the (A) substitution polymorphism changes the amino acid to a methionine.  This alters the structure of the resultant enzyme such that its activity is only 25% of the wild type.  As a result, A allele carriers have more dopamine in their prefrontal cortex, which may be responsible for many of the neuropsychological associations listed below.\n\n[http://blog.23andme.com/2009/07/31/dna-variation-may-help-us-break-free-from-our-routines/ 23andMe blog] summarizes the alleles at this SNP as\n*[[rs4680]](A) = Worrier. Met, more exploratory, lower COMT enzymatic activity, therefore higher dopamine levels; lower pain threshold, enhanced vulnerability to stress, yet also more efficient at processing information under most conditions\n*[[rs4680]](G) = Warrior. Val, less exploratory, higher COMT enzymatic activity, therefore lower dopamine levels; higher pain threshold, better stress resiliency, albeit with a modest reduction in executive cognition performance under most conditions\n\nRoughly speaking, the predominant wisdom (known colloquially as the warrior/worrier hypothesis; summary at {{PMID|17008817}}) posits that people with Val alleles have increased COMT activity and lower prefrontal extracellular dopamine compared with those with the Met substitution. Val158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in the processing of aversive stimuli (warrior strategy), while Met158 alleles may be associated with an advantage in memory and attention tasks (worrier strategy). Under conditions of increased dopamine release (eg, stress), individuals with Val158 alleles may have improved dopaminergic transmission and better performance, while individuals with Met158 alleles may have less efficient neurotransmission and worse performance. Some evidence suggests that Val158 alleles are associated with schizophrenia, while Met158 alleles are associated with anxiety.\n\nSpecific studies include:\n\n[[rs4680]], a functional Val/Met polymorphism, showed modest association with Irish familial [[schizophrenia]].

The minor allele (i.e. A1, [[rs1800497]](T)) is associated with a reduced number of dopamine binding sites in the brain {{PMID|9672901}}, and it has been postulated to play a role in [[alcoholism]], [[smoking]], and certain neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\nThe reduced number of dopamine binding sites may play a role in nicotine addiction by causing an \"understimulated\" state that can be relieved by smoking (and/or use of other drugs).{{PMID|8873216}} It may also be associated with reduced response to errors and increased addictive behavior.{{PMID|18063800}}\n\nA wide variety of reports have been published over more than ten years either linking [[rs1800497]] to aspects of nicotine use and smoking cessation success, or finding no such association. A meta-analysis of 41 such studies published in 2004 concluded that overall the association of [[rs1800497]] with such phenomena was statistically weak. {{PMID|15370155}} This same group published (in 2009) a study showing no association between rs1800497 and improved response to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), contrary to their previous study.{{PMID|19273465}}\n\nMore recently, a relatively large study of over 700 patients attempting to kick their smoking habit using the drug [[bupropion]] determined that smokers homozygous for the A2/A2 genotype were more successful than A1/A2 or A1/A1 individuals. The A2/A2 smokers were more than three times as likely, relative to placebo, to be abstinent at end of treatment (35.2% vs. 15.1%; odds ratio = 3.25, CI: 2.00-5.28) and at 6 months of follow-up (26.7% vs. 12.2%; odds ratio = 2.81, CI: 1.66-4.77), whereas not so much by 12 months (16.3% vs. 10.7%; OR = 1.70, CI: 0.95-3.05). Basically, A1/A2 and A1/A1 genotype smokers didn't gain anything from using [[bupropion]] versus placebo; [[bupropion]] only helped A2/A2 genotypes stop smoking. {{PMID|18058343|OA=1\n}}\n\nIn a study of individuals in the Polyp Prevention Trial with any, multiple (>/=2) or advanced colorectal adenoma recurrence after 4 years, compared to those without adenoma recurrence, [[rs1800497]](T;T) individuals were significantly associated with all advanced adenoma recurrence (odds ratio 2.40, CI: 1.11-5.20).  The authors speculate this increased risk of adenoma recurrence (and an association with [[colorectal cancer]]) may be related to SNP-associated differences in alcohol and fat intake.{{PMID| 19065655|OA=1\n}}\n\nA 2014 preliminary study links an individual's [[ANKK1]] [[rs1800497]] genotype as likely to experience greater positive subjective effects following cocaine exposure, including greater 'high' and 'like', and these individuals may have increased vulnerability to continue using cocaine or they may be at greater risk to relapse during periods of abstinence. The study states that replication of these findings is necessary to confirm these findings.{{PMID|24528631|OA=1}}\n\nSNPs [[rs6276]], [[rs6277]], and [[rs1800497]]) in the human [[DRD2]] gene are associated with decreased [[D2R]] expression and function, as well as [[high blood pressure]].  Data supports the hypothesis that [[D2R]] function has protective effects in human renal proximal tubule cells [[hRPTCs]] and suggest that carriers of these SNPs may be prone to [[chronic renal disease]] and [[high blood pressure]].  {{PMID|24379187|OA=1\n}}\n\nSNPs, [[rs1800497]] and [[rs2283265]], located near and within the dopamine receptor 2 [[DRD2]] gene, respectively, were significantly associated with improvements during working memory training (p < .003 and p < .0004, respectively). {{PMID|24001007}}\n\n{{PMID|18698520|OA=1\n}} A small (54 patient) study of patients with traumatic brain injury concluded that carriers of [[rs1800497]](A) alleles recover slower as assessed by memory and attention tests.\n\n[http://blog.23andme.com/2008/10/16/genetics-may-dull-brains-pleasure-response-to-food-causing-weight-gain/ 23andMe blog] diminished pleasure response from food\n\n{{PMID Auto\n|PMID=19344737\n|Title=Associations of the DRD2 TaqIA Polymorphism with Impulsivity and Substance Use: Preliminary Results from a Clinical Sample of Adolescents.\n|OA=1\n}}\n{{PMID Auto\n|PMID=19373123\n|Title=Genetic variants altering dopamine D2 receptor expression or function modulate the risk of opiate addiction and the dosage requirements of methadone substitution\n}}\n\n{{omim\n|id=608774\n|desc=ANKYRIN REPEAT AND KINASE DOMAIN CONTAINING 1;
